# Polygon Visualization using Folium library

This project fetches polygon data from a remote API, decodes the polygon points, and visualizes the polygons on a map using the Folium library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 
- requests library-3 folium library
- Jupyter Noteboob

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.6 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

	pip install requests folium

Clone or download the project files from the repository

## Usage

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook.

2. Open the notebook file (Frontend_Code.ipynb).

3. Run each cell of the notebook sequentially to execute the code.

After executing the last cell, a map will be displayed in the notebook showing the polygons with their respective fill colors.
